## Getting Started

To run the following project follow the steps below:

```bash
- npm install
- copy the content from .env.example to .env
- npm run dev
```

##Notes
- The initial plan was to create the page with SSR, but because of time constraints I did a more
basic approach. 
- Because I could not find pagination options for the api I retrieved all the data
- After I noticed that my time started to run out I omitted typescript types so and started to ignored 
some warning so can finish the task in time.
- I initially intended to add some unit tests but because of time constraints I did not implement any
- The code can be improved but I decided that the most important part is for the code to work
then I tried to the best variant with the time allocated.
